# Description

This work was developed as a part of a software development class and as a part of the coding for social impact project. In it we worked with an external teacher that was our client (other groups had companies) to develop an easy to use web scraping platform. This web scraping platform had 3 main components; a frontend web application, the backend server for it, and the web scraping engine.

This work was done in a team of 5 using the scrum agile methodology, utilizing CI/CD and code reviews
