# Description

This work was developed as part of an object oriented programing class. For it a simple 2D strategy rpg was created, which was developed with the intent of easy to extend RPG systems. The spell list would was easy to increase as well as adding new units to the field. Spell could have a completely custom area of effect of range which was programatically defined. There was an elemental defence system where different characters had different elemental strengths and resistences and the player was meant to exploit them. The enemy units were designed via a behavior tree which due to time constraints was emulated based on good old if statements. The game also had a simple facebook integration to share when a player was playing or when he won a match.
