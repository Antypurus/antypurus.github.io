# Description

This work was developed as part of a distributed systems class, and its object was to introduce the concept of multicast via the development of a file backup network. This was developed in java with no additional libraries besides the java standard library. Files had to be broken down into several chunks which were independently sent over the network. This application also had to work with the implementation from other students. Remote method invocation was used to issue command to the backup application from a separate application.
