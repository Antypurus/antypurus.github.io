# Description

This game was developed as a part of a game development class and served the purpose of introducing us to development using a game engine, in our case Unity. We were tasked with developing a dungeon crawler 2D game themed around our faculty, and as such we ran with the concept and just made a completely random dungeon crawler where teachers are the enemies, trying to fail us and hit us with one of their memes and the final boss is the course founder. In general the game was very simple with most of the working having to go into the random dungeon generation due to Unities lackluster 2D tools. This being said, as a first game we were happy and we think it came out fun.
