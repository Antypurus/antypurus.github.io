                So, who am I? Well, some would call me bipolar, but at the very least I have not been formally diagnosed
                but that does not stop me from switching from cracking jokes to being ultra-serious in a snap of a
                finger.
                <br><br>
                On a more serious note, when it comes to software engineering I can be very serious, I do believe that,
                in general, software development nowadays is not in a good spot, I absolutely hate the modern stack
                overflow culture and sometimes I just wish that website would close down. I know its not their fault,
                but at least it would close the main avenue that led to this culture of crappy slow software.
                Thankfully, bit by bit things seem to be changing now that Moore’s law is dead, and we cannot just throw
                more hardware at the problem. I am not saying all my code is perfect and efficient to the max, but at
                least I acknowledge the importance of performance and strive for efficiency. When it comes to my code, I
                strive to write scalable, efficient, extendable, and easy to read code. At the end of the day I like to
                have fun coding, and I sure as hell do not have fun working on crappy code. From this once can easily
                surmise that I hate web development… yeah… it's true, I have no interested in working on your typical
                web project, if you want to talk about this privately go ahead and message me, I would love to chat,
                that being said I don’t want to waste more lines on web…
                <br><br>
                So, the question is what do I like to work on? Well, that is easy real-time systems and computer
                graphics. I love performance, I just do, the idea of utilizing the hardware’s capabilities to its
                fullest, finding hotspots and optimizing them and using intrinsics, all that makes me giddy. And then
                there is computer graphics, I don’t know how to explain it but I just like it, maybe it’s the
                intersection between art, complexity and performance requirements, all I can say is despite how hard it
                is I have never been more attached to working on something, I fail and I fail and I fail, but I always
                get back up and continue with it. The fact of the matter is no other computing field captivated me like
                computer graphics, so I cannot imagine a life where I do not work on computer graphics at the very least
                in my free time.
                <br><br>
                On a more personal note, you could say I am your typical nerd. I love video games, especially RPGs. I
                spend way too much time watching anime. And I am always down for a good session of dungeons and dragons.
                That being said, I do like having philosophical and political discussions, all though I refrain from
                having those publicly for my own sake. I try to get along with everyone and always try to be cheerful,
                so as long as you are not annoying and obnoxious feel free to talk to me.
