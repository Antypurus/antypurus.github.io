# Description

This work was developed as a part of a software development class and as a part of the coding for social impact project. In it we worked with an external teacher that was our client (other groups had companies) to develop an easy to use web scraping platform. This web scraping platform had 3 main components; a frontend web applicatoin, the backend server for it, and the web scraping engine.
